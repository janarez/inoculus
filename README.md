## About

InOculus is a simple desktop timer designed to push you towards taking breaks from computer screen.

It automatically cycles between focus and break intervals. During focus the InOculus timer counts down remaining focus time. During break a break screen with countdown appears on all monitors and counts down remaining break time. If needed the break screen can be dismissed straight away.

### Name

InOculus was created to help protect eyes by relieving eyestrain. The name is derived from Latin and means In 'in' + Oculus 'eye' that is "in the eye". Simultaneously, it spells and reads similarly to the English word innocuous meaning 'not harmful'.
